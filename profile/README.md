## 🧬 About Us

**roc7d‑labs** is an independent research group focused on building **local, private, multimodal medical AI systems**.  
Our work emphasizes:

- **Local inference** (no cloud dependency)
- **Medical safety + privacy**
- **Multimodal intelligence** (text, vision, audio)
- **Efficient model deployment on consumer hardware**
- **Reproducible research and transparent engineering**

We develop practical tools and prototypes that enable clinicians, researchers, and engineers to explore medical AI safely and privately.

## 🔬 Current Flagship Project

### **Medic‑🔬‑Doc‑ESP‑AI**
A multimodal medical AI assistant designed for:

- Medical Q&A (text)
- Medical image interpretation (vision)
- Medical audio transcription (speech)
- Local execution on macOS and Linux
- Strict privacy and confidentiality

Repo:  
👉 https://github.com/roc7d-labs/medic-doc-esp-ai

## 🧠 Research Focus Areas

- **Medical LLMs** (Phi‑4, MedGemma, LLaVA‑Med)
- **Model quantization** for edge devices
- **Secure local inference pipelines**
- **Memory‑efficient multimodal architectures**
- **Medical dataset preprocessing**
- **Evaluation frameworks for clinical reasoning**

## 🔐 Licensing Philosophy

Our work uses a **Custom Dual License**:

- **Non‑commercial use permitted**
- **Commercial use requires explicit written permission**
- **Strict no‑redistribution and no reverse engineering**

This ensures responsible use of medical AI technologies.
